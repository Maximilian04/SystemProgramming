# SystemProgramming
My educational path in MIPT

## Content
This is the gathering of my educational projects. I'm educating in MIPT, System programming and applied mathematics, in the first grade (now, summer 2022).

I use raw C and C++ without most modern tools. Compiler - GCC (Mingw32). Also use makefiles and Doxygen.

List of projects:
